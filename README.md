# PDF Merger Node for n8n

A custom node to merge two PDF files in your n8n workflows. Overlay a house style PDF onto a content PDF, with fallback handling for differing page counts.

---

## üìñ Overview

The **PDF Merger Node** allows you to:
- Overlay a "house style" PDF onto a "content" PDF.
- Handle differences in page counts gracefully.
- Output a merged PDF file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Node Configuration

### Inputs
- **House Style PDF**: Binary property for the house style file (default: `binaryData1`).
- **Content PDF**: Binary property for the content file (default: `binaryData2`).

### Output
- **Merged PDF**: The combined PDF file as a binary property (`merged.pdf`).
